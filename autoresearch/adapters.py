"""Resolution layer for the `research` fan-out.

`research` routes through each channel's own ``Channel.search(query, limit)`` —
the single source of truth (channels wrap the upstream tools; autoresearch only
routes, never reimplements). This module decides WHICH channels run for a given
request, given doctor-reported activity and the requested ``--channels`` list.
The per-channel search/normalization logic lives in ``autoresearch/channels/``.
